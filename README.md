Please note. We use github for versioning purposes only. If anyone wants the actual data involved it will always be easily accessible via the ONS website (www.ons.gov.uk) and API service. tables.

## Setup & Prep
1.) Download this repository with the "download ZIP" button.

2.) Unzip everything into its own folder.

3.) You will need to copy all 4 source files required into this folder. The filenames might vary but are essentially: FDI inwards, FDI outwards, Assets, Liabilities.

## Explanation

The various tabs from these 4 spreadsheets combine to give us 10 distinct explorable datasets as outline in the table below.

## Usage

These scripts are run from a batch file (there's too much going on to really build an convenient mouse click launcher).

To use it:

1.) Right click and edit the "click to run" file.

2.) Update both the file names and extensions (either .xls or .xlsx) at the top of the file as shown belowL

Note the "DONT..." instruction. Anything below that never changes.

3.) Save, exit and double click the file to extract and transform the data.
